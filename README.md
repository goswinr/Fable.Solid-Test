# Minimal Fable Solid

A minimal Fable.Solid app using the latest version of Fable , SolidJs, Vite and vite-plugin-solid.

Fable build and recompile to .jsx works, **but** Vite does not pick up the changes and reload the browser.

Run the following commands to start watching on localhost:
```bash
npm i
npm start
```
